import Remix from "@site/src/components/remix";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import FtsoV2ChangeQuoteFeed from "!!raw-loader!/examples/developer-hub-solidity/FtsoV2ChangeQuoteFeed.sol";
import SetEvmVersionRemix from "/static/img/set-evm-version-remix.png";

This guide will show you how to fetch the latest feed values for two feeds and convert them to a new quote feed. For example, if you need the price of `BTC/ETH`, you can fetch the latest feed values for `BTC/USD` and `ETH/USD` and calculate the price of `BTC/ETH = (BTC/USD) / (ETH/USD)`.

In the following smart contract, for `BTC/USD` (feed index `2`) and `ETH/USD` (feed index `9`), returning the value of `BTC/ETH`, the function signature would be:

```solidity
getNewQuoteFeedValue([2, 9])
```

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="FtsoV2ChangeQuoteFeed.sol">

:::warning[When compiling and deploying the contract]

- **Using Remix:** Set EVM version to `london` in the **Advanced Configurations** section of the **Solidity Compiler** tab:

  <img src={SetEvmVersionRemix} style={{ width: 300 }} />

- **Using Hardhat or Foundry:** Set EVM version to `london` in [hardhat.config.ts](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter/blob/master/hardhat.config.ts#L34) or [foundry.toml](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-foundry-starter/blob/master/foundry.toml).

- **Using Standard Solidity JSON:** Set `evmVersion` to `london`:

  ```json
  {
    "settings": {
      "optimizer": {
        /* ... */
      },
      "evmVersion": "london"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Using `solc` CLI:** Set `--evm-version` to `london`:

  ```bash
  solc --evm-version london <args>
  ```

<details>
<summary>Didn't understand the Solidity code?</summary>

- **Purpose**: This contract interacts with the Flare Network to fetch feed values and compute a new quote feed value based on the base and quote feed values.

- **Dependencies**:

  - `ContractRegistry.sol`: Used to get the addresses of various contracts on the Flare network.
  - `FtsoV2Interface.sol`: This interface allows interaction with the FTSOv2 contract, which provides real-time price feeds for various assets.

- **State Variables**:

  - `ftsoV2`: This is a state variable of type `FtsoV2Interface`. It will hold the address of the FTSO V2 contract once initialized.

- **Constructor**:

  - The constructor is a special function that runs only once when the contract is deployed. It initializes the `ftsoV2` state variable by fetching the FTSO V2 contract address using the `ContractRegistry`.

- **Internal Function `_scaleBaseFeedValue`**:

  - Scales the base feed value to match the decimals of the quote feed.
  - Adjusts the feed value by scaling up or down depending on the difference in decimals.

- **External Function `getNewQuoteFeedValue`**:

  - Accepts an array of feed indexes (base and quote feed indexes).
  - Fetches current feed values and decimals using `ftsoV2`.
  - Scales the base feed value to match the quote feed decimals.
  - Computes and returns the new quote feed value by adjusting for the decimal differences and performing a calculation.

- **Key Validations**:
  - Ensures exactly two feed indexes are provided.
  - Prevents division by zero during the computation of the new quote feed value.
